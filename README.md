**C3X** is a mod that makes many improvements to the Civ 3 Conquests EXE. It adds quality of life features including stack unit commands (shown below) and an end-of-turn warning for cities about to riot. C3X also fixes many long standing bugs, including the infamous submarine bug, deepens the AI's ability to fight by enabling it to use artillery and army units, and reduces turn times by correcting a major inefficiency in the game's trade network calculation. C3X also forms a platform for other mods by enabling various gameplay changes not possible through the editor. Examples include resource generation from buildings, era-specific names for leaders and civs, limited trespassing and railroad movement like in Civ 4, and a broad expansion of the zone of control and defensive bombard abilities.

|Stack unit commands. Holding the control key converts most unit action buttons into stack buttons, which issue their commands to all units of the same type on the same tile. Similarly, holding control when selecting a tile to bombard performs a stack bombard. Also note the grouping of units and movement indicators on the right-click menus.|
