Functions that set main_screen_form.Mode_Action (0x9FD5CC):
FUN_004D8620 (when right clicking to cancel)
	calls set or clear cursor then FUN_006268A0
FUN_004DF510 (when cancelling with other command e.g. press F to fortify)
	if main_screen_form.Mode_Action != 0, calls clear cursor then FUN_006268A0
FUN_004D8690 (to activate e.g. after pressing B)
	calls FUN_006268A0 unless call is redundant
FUN_004D8790 (after clicking to bombard)
	same as prev
FUN_004D9620 (after cancelling normal bombard by pressing Shift+B)
	calls FUN_6268A0 if it sets Mode_Action
Main_Screen_Form::handle_key_down (after cancelling bombard by skipping turn)
	calls FUN_6268A0 if it sets Mode_Action



Alright, this should work:
button press on SB button sets SB flag
call to handle_cursor_change checks Mode_Action and clears SB if it isn't (air) bombard
call to handle_key_down clears SB flag. This one is too aggressive, what if the key down is to pan the map or open an adivor screen? Should we compare the key to a white or black list? I think it's best to have the key only clear the flag when it's something that wouldn't change the cursor b/c otherwise we would catch it. So we need to catch B and (for precision strike) P.
