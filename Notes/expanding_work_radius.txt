
To test addresses:
  - click map to work a tile
  - sell harbor, verify food updates correctly for worker in 3+ ring
  - found city
  - raze city
  - grow city, also w/ wonder that grows two at a time
  - starve city
  - join a worker
  - click center city tile to manage citizens
  - kick a citizen off of a tile by moving a hostile unit onto it
  - run through a bunch of turns w/ automated workers
  - set city production to something that gets mobilization bonus
  - spawn and clear pollution
  - have pollution kick a citizen off a tile
  - kick a citizen off a tile by founding a city on it
  - test various city screen things: click to work tile, click off tile, hover, click center tile

GOG/Steam/PCG patch locations for expanded city work radius (0x):
4adb68/4b4b4c/4adbf8 [jumps: 6/6/6 eax/ebp/eax]
  in add_or_remove_improvement
  ...basically should check every call to calc_tile_yield_at
4ae51e/4b5504/4ae5ae [jumps: 6/6/6 ebx/eax/ebx]
  sets tile flags in City::initialize
4ae83b/4b580c/4ae8cb [jumps: 6/2/6 eax/ebx/eax]
  another loop in City::initialize
  annoying example of a 2-byte jump
4af02d/4b5ffc/4af0bd [jumps: 6/6/6 eax/ebx/eax], 4af0c7/4b6092/4af157 [jumps: 6/6/6 eax/eax/eax]
  in City::raze, double loop to clear tile flags around the city
  ...this is why it would be difficult to have workable ranges that vary between cities
4af3d4/4b639d/4af464 [jumps: 6/6/6 ebp/ebx/ebp]
  in City::raze, again setting tile flags (feels redundant)
4af5a3/4b6568/4af633 [jumps: 6/6/6 ebp/ebp/ebp]
  in City::raze, looks like setting a dirty flag re: visibility
4afcf4
  in City::set_production, re: mobilization bonus
4b1040
  recomputing tile yields
4b2489, 4b2620
  in City::update_growth, again recomputing yields
  ...basically should check every call to add_or_remove_tile_yield
4ba197
  in City::add_population
4ba677
  in City::remove_population
4bb4eb
  in City::controls_tile
  cut out this check by editing the jump. we've replicated this check in the patched version of City::controls_tile
43550a
  in City::find_min_value_tile (m13)
4356ef, 4357d0, 435954
  in City::manage_by_governor (m14)
435d67
  in City::instruct_worker (m15), sets lim for Map::compute_neighbor_index
4367fe
  in City::find_best_tile_to_work
436981
  in City::m17
4373b1
  in City::m23
42053d
  in City_Form::handle_left_click, call to Map::compute_neighbor_index
420547
  in City_Form::handle_left_click, redundantly checks the index returned from above
  cut out this check entirely by editing the jump instr here
420efe, 42117b
  in funcs called by City_Form::draw, drawing tiles around city
421047
  in second func above, lim on compute_neighbor_index
5da3a8
  in Tile::m56_Set_Tile_Flags, lim on compute_neighbor_index


Consider radius for resources. That should be expanded too, no?
  one place that would need to be edited is has_resources_required_by_building_r


Locations NOT patched (yet):
4b2ac2 - counting foreign tiles around city for culture flip
4b479b - for triggering disease
56b8ae - for revealing area around capital after establishing embassy
443cde - for AI judging whether to raze a city
461a99 - for forest harvesting
442b9c - in ai_eval_city_location
442ecf - again ^^^
5f3668 - in Map::m17
4ddbf8 - not a loop, a condition checking ni < 0x15, need to investigate
4de1e1 - related to drawing something (?)
44427a - check for resources around an area
565329 - something about visibility or FOW around captured cities
494c4d - revealing tiles
526ce9 - revealing tiles for investigate city mission
4ddcca - in a method for Main_Screen_Form
4373b4 - in City::m23, computes defense priority (I think), shouldn't patch
438ee4 - checking for resources again




tile counts for each workable radius, inc. city center:
1: 9
2: 21
3: 37
4: 61
5: 89
6: 137
7: 193 <-- count for a hypothetical 7th ring at one million culture
