4adb68
  in add_or_remove_improvement
  ...basically should check every call to calc_tile_yield_at
4ae51e
  sets tile flags in City::initialize
4ae83b
  another loop in City::initialize
4af02d, 4af0c7
  in City::raze, double loop to clear tile flags around the city
  ...this is why it would be difficult to have workable ranges that vary between cities
4af3d4
  in City::raze, again setting tile flags (feels redundant)
4af5a3
  in City::raze, looks like setting a dirty flag re: visibility
4afcf4
  in City::set_production, re: mobilization bonus
4b1040
  recomputing tile yields
4b2489, 4b2620
  in City::update_growth, again recomputing yields
  ...basically should check every call to add_or_remove_tile_yield
4ba197
  in City::add_population
4ba677
  in City::remove_population
4bb4e8
  in City::controls_tile
  ...this one is different from the others since it's not a loop condition. ez to patch though


Locations NOT patched:
4b2abb - counting foreign tiles around city for culture flip
4b3098 - for spawning pollution
4b4794 - for triggering disease


tile counts for each workable radius, inc. city center:
1: 9
2: 21
3: 37
4: 61
5: 89
6: 137
7: 193 <-- count for a hypothetical 7th ring at one million culture
