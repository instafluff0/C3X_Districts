4adb68
  in add_or_remove_improvement
  ...basically should check every call to calc_tile_yield_at
4ae51e
  sets tile flags in City::initialize
4ae83b
  another loop in City::initialize
4af02d, 4af0c7
  in City::raze, double loop to clear tile flags around the city
  ...this is why it would be difficult to have workable ranges that vary between cities
4af3d4
  in City::raze, again setting tile flags (feels redundant)
4af5a3
  in City::raze, looks like setting a dirty flag re: visibility
4afcf4
  in City::set_production, re: mobilization bonus
4b1040
  recomputing tile yields
4b2489, 4b2620
  in City::update_growth, again recomputing yields
  ...basically should check every call to add_or_remove_tile_yield
4ba197
  in City::add_population
4ba677
  in City::remove_population
4bb4eb
  in City::controls_tile
  cut out this check by editing the jump. we've replicated this check in the patched version of City::controls_tile
43550a
  in City::find_min_value_tile (m13)
4356ef, 4357d0, 435954
  in City::manage_by_governor (m14)
435d67
  in City::instruct_worker (m15), sets lim for Map::compute_neighbor_index
4367fe
  in City::find_best_tile_to_work
436981
  in City::m17
4373b1
  in City::m23
42053d
  in City_Form::handle_left_click, call to Map::compute_neighbor_index
420547
  in City_Form::handle_left_click, redundantly checks the index returned from above
  cut out this check entirely by editing the jump instr here
420efe, 42117b
  in funcs called by City_Form::draw, drawing tiles around city
421047
  in second func above, lim on compute_neighbor_index
5da3a8
  in Tile::m56_Set_Tile_Flags, lim on compute_neighbor_index


Consider radius for resources. That should be expanded too, no?
  one place that would need to be edited is has_resources_required_by_building_r


Locations NOT patched:
4b2abb - counting foreign tiles around city for culture flip
4b3098 - for spawning pollution
4b4794 - for triggering disease
435404 - for checking for pollution or craters in range (maybe should patch this one)




tile counts for each workable radius, inc. city center:
1: 9
2: 21
3: 37
4: 61
5: 89
6: 137
7: 193 <-- count for a hypothetical 7th ring at one million culture
