Check out the call at 0x466B95. It looks like the parameters are in the wrong order.

In a normal single player game, the call to perform_interturn occurs at 0x4F6759. The loop before that is the main interface loop that runs during the player's turn.

DAT_00a526c0 might be a bit field of active/alive players. See its usage in FUN_0057de90.

a52e84: pointer to array of UnitItem, each is {int field_0; UnitBody * b;}
a52e90: Also it's part of some object that gets static init'd at 0x537c00.
Based on runtime investigation, it's not a pointer. Maybe capacity of something?

5bc8b0: Unit::get_ability with special logic for flags other than army and in special circumstances. Try to figure out what it's doing some time. So far I don't know what the special circumstances are that FUN_005bc6d0 doesn't return -1.

5b2b20: Short leaf function. Looks like it takes Units. Shouldn't be too difficult to figure out.





5bb650: Unit::is_visible_to

56d630: Relevant to the submarine bug
I think this is the get owner function that Antal1987 was talking about.
This is the source of the bug. When the player checks ownership of a tile with an AI sub, this returns the AI's civ ID but when the AI checks ownership of a tile with the player's sub, this returns -1 indicating that the tile is unowned. The AI then tries to move onto that tile and triggers combat.
The problem is that changing this function to tell the AI about player ownership of a tile might trigger the AI to attack invisible player units. Perhaps the player's units should only be revealed during peace time?



466f40: some kind of unit move function. I think it's for a unit with a given path.
Break point set there, for the AI frigate, it called:
