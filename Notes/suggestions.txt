Ideas:
- Cash rush costs are pre-exploited, i.e., you only pay double for shields up to the cost of the cheapest thing you could rush
- Cities do not unassign citizens from polluted tiles (arguably not convenient since you're potentially losing the specialist yield)
- [from tjs282] Assign the minimum number of workers necessary to clean pollution

- [from tjs282 and vmxa] Fix barb diagonal attack bug https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/sub-bug-fix-and-other-adventures-in-exe-modding.666881/page-4#post-16050292, there's a link to another thread with info about the bug in that post
  - vmxa says: "The barb diagonal bug was caused by a patch we asked for long ago to fix the AI marching units from tile to tile and back again, till all movement was used. This broke the barbs hunting and they ignore units if they were on the wrong diag path. It can be corrected with a setting in the ini that turns the marching back on. At least that is what I recall from many years ago. The marching was only an issue in huge games."
