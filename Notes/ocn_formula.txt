ocn: Leader (L) -> int
ocn = max (1, floor(s_diff * (b + n_fp + n_com + n_gov + n_ai) / 100))
where
    b is base OCN from map size

    n_fp is OCN contrib from forbidden palaces:
      n_fp = floor((3*f*b) / d)
      where
        f = number of forbidden palaces in L's empire
        d = 8 if L's govt does NOT have communal corruption else 1

    n_com is contrib from commercial trait:
      n_com = floor(b/4) if L has the trait else 0

    n_gov is contrib from govt:
      n_gov = | floor(b/8) if L's govt has minimal or nuisance corruption
              | floor(b/16) if problematic
              | 2*b if communal
              | 0 otherwise

    n_ai is special contrib for AI players:
      n_ai = 0 if human player else | 0 if game difficulty set <= 2
                                    | floor(b/8) if set to 3
                                    | floor(b/4) if set to 4
                                    | floor(b/2) if set >= 5

    s_diff is scaling for player's set difficulty. In the editor this is called "percentage of optimal cities" for each difficulty level. The level used here is per-player NOT the overall game difficulty.



NOTE: This formula assumes that b is non-negative. The actual code does not make this assumption, but the editor only allows b to be set within [1, 1000].
