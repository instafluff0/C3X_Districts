- Add "duration" column that allows specification of NoteOff's delta time
- Enable addition and deletion of rows
- Sort rows by play time
- Pop up warning when previewing AMB with missing WAV files

Final things:
- Harden all the various s(n)printf calls against buffer overflow
- Remove popup after editing cell. Cut down on error popups.
- Update About popup
- Fix margins, column widths, etc.
- Include AMB Editor in assemble_release.bat

Low priority:
- Figure out how to dispose of SoundCore objects properly
  - This will also mean we can clean up the temp directory more quickly
- It would be nice if this editor could be used to fix broken files, like GalleyAttack.amb, where the var names don't match
