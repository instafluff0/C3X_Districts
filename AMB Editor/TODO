Final things:
- In GalleyAttack.amb, inputting "0.110" time produces 0.108 but inputting "0.111" gives 0.110. Rounding issue?

Low priority:
- Add row on HopliteAttackA.amb doesn't work properly b/c of the orphan sound track
- Put asterisk in window title if there are unsaved changes
- Option to create a "new" AMB file
- Consider moving all .c files into a source folder
- Consider adding a column with program numbers
- Figure out how to dispose of SoundCore objects properly
  - This will also mean we can clean up the temp directory more quickly
- It would be nice if this editor could be used to fix broken files, like GalleyAttack.amb, where the var names don't match
