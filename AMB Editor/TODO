Final things:
- Write a README
- Check the other files with orphaned Kmap chunks; Modify AMBReader.py to properly check for references from tracks to Prgm chunks

Low priority:
- Put asterisk in window title if there are unsaved changes
- Option to create a "new" AMB file
- Consider moving all .c files into a source folder
- Consider adding a column with program numbers
- Figure out how to dispose of SoundCore objects properly
  - This will also mean we can clean up the temp directory more quickly
- It would be nice if this editor could be used to fix broken files, like GalleyAttack.amb, where the var names don't match
