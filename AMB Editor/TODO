- Forbid editing slashes into WAV file names
- Enable editing of play times
- Enable addition and deletion of rows
- Add undo & redo functions
- Figure out why some AMBs don't load e.g. the F-15

Final things:
- Harden all the various s(n)printf calls against buffer overflow
- Update About popup
- Include AMB Editor in assemble_release.bat

Low priority:
- Figure out how to dispose of SoundCore objects properly
  - This will also mean we can clean up the temp directory more quickly
