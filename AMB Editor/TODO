- Sort rows by play time
- Pop up warning when previewing AMB with missing WAV files. Also make the file names red if they don't match any file.
- Look at IroncladAttack.amb. It's odd how the effect and track names don't match for the explosion effects but they play anyway. It might be that Prgms and tracks are matched by number instead of name.

Final things:
- Harden all the various s(n)printf calls against buffer overflow
- Update About popup
- Fix margins, column widths, etc.
- Include AMB Editor in assemble_release.bat

Low priority:
- Figure out how to dispose of SoundCore objects properly
  - This will also mean we can clean up the temp directory more quickly
- It would be nice if this editor could be used to fix broken files, like GalleyAttack.amb, where the var names don't match
