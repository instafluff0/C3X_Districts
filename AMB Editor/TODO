- Add "duration" column that allows specification of NoteOff's delta time
- Enable addition and deletion of rows
- Sort rows by play time
- Figure out why some AMBs don't load e.g. the F-15
  - The issue here is filling the ListView; track names must be matched to effect names ignoring case
- Pop up warning when previewing AMB with missing WAV files

Final things:
- Harden all the various s(n)printf calls against buffer overflow
- Remove popup after editing cell. Cut down on error popups.
- Update About popup
- Fix margins, column widths, etc.
- Include AMB Editor in assemble_release.bat

Low priority:
- Figure out how to dispose of SoundCore objects properly
  - This will also mean we can clean up the temp directory more quickly
