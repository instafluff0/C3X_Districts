- Option to prune unconnected pieces from the file, in particular Kmaps not referred to by any Prgm, Prgms not referred to by any track, and tracks with invalid Prgm indices
- Think about error handling regarding the install dir. I think right now it just crashes if you try to play a preview without an install dir set.

Final things:
- Harden all the various s(n)printf calls against buffer overflow
- Update About popup
- Include AMB Editor in assemble_release.bat

Low priority:
- Put asterisk in window title if there are unsaved changes
- Option to create a "new" AMB file
- Consider moving all .c files into a source folder
- Consider adding a column with program numbers
- Figure out how to dispose of SoundCore objects properly
  - This will also mean we can clean up the temp directory more quickly
- It would be nice if this editor could be used to fix broken files, like GalleyAttack.amb, where the var names don't match
