Low priority:
- ArcherRun.amb is missing WAV file names for breath sounds. This is fixable.
- Add row on HopliteAttackA.amb doesn't work properly b/c of the orphan sound track

- Warning when you run multiple instances of the editor. Doing so breaks playing of previews.
- Option to create a "new" AMB file
- Consider moving all .c files into a source folder
- Consider adding a column with program numbers
