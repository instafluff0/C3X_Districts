- Verify that all delta times are zero for all sound track events before the NoteOn event
- Enable editing of play times
- Enable addition and deletion of rows
- Sort rows by play time
- Figure out why some AMBs don't load e.g. the F-15
- Pop up warning when previewing AMB with missing WAV files

Final things:
- Harden all the various s(n)printf calls against buffer overflow
- Remove popup after editing cell. Cut down on error popups.
- Update About popup
- Fix margins, column widths, etc.
- Include AMB Editor in assemble_release.bat

Low priority:
- Figure out how to dispose of SoundCore objects properly
  - This will also mean we can clean up the temp directory more quickly
