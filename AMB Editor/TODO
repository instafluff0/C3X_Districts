- Make sure previews properly reflect changes in the editor. It may be necessary to create a unique AMB file each time due to sound.dll locking the files.
- Does PreviewAmbFile need to take any parameter at all? Actually, it should take the AMB object itself instead of a file path now.
- Forbid editing slashes into WAV file names
- Add undo & redo functions
- Add window showing AMB file text description

Final things:
- Harden all the various s(n)printf calls against buffer overflow
- Update About popup
- Include AMB Editor in assemble_release.bat

Low priority:
- Figure out how to dispose of SoundCore objects properly
  - This will also mean we can clean up the temp directory more quickly
