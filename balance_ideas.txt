* Buff fascism
  - Permanent mobilization bonus? Not too interesting.
  - Military police also reduce corruption like police specialists
    - Mostly useful in second tier cities so fits nicely with fascism as the small civ war govt vs communism for large
      civs
    - Undermines fascism as a war time govt b/c when you're at war you want your units fighting not sitting in cities
  - The problem is that fascism needs a "thing," some big benefit that is highly valuable depending on circumstances &
    goals. It could be the "oh shit I'm behind, bet everything on a huge war" govt, that would have nice historical
    flavor. The problem is that the way you'd do that is by rushing for rep. parts then flight, i.e., you need research,
    i.e., you need to stay in republic.
  - Also need to consider its place on the tech tree. Even if it were a good govt, it might still not be worth pursuing
    b/c you'd have to put off railroads, factories, rep. parts, and ToE.
  - Allows construction of small wonder that, when build, allows its city to ignore tech restrictions for unit
    construction. Thematically fits with famous Nazi super-weapons programs. Hopefully not too OP since you'd still need
    to unlock the necessary resources, but could hopefully open up some interesting and unique strategies.

* Buff expansionist
  - Free border expansion on city founding
  - Take OCN bonus from commercial. I like this idea since it would keep expansionist useful into the late game but then
    commercial would need to be given a new ability to compensate.

* Move riverside food bonus from agricultural to seafaring

* Military great leader can perform coup when in the capital, allowing player to change govt w/o anarchy.
  - Makes govt changes more viable in the late game
  - Mostly pointless unless govts besides republic are buffed because as it is there's rarely any reason to switch into
    them even if it weren't for the lost turns.

* Universal Suffrage reduces WW by one level instead of by one unhappy face.

* Similar to the idea w/ military great leaders, could add a wonder that gives free govt changes. Call it "Constitution"
  and have it unlocked with Democracy, that way the tech is valuable for something other than trading and it comes just
  in time for the last govt techs. The historical flavor doesn't really make sense, though, since constitutions are
  supposed to make the govt's principles more permanent and this wonder would make them less so but I don't know what
  else to call it, maybe something French, like to do with Napoleon?
