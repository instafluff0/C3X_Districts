Ideas:
- AIs propose he most favorable trade they'll accept instead of making the player work for it
- Cash rush costs are pre-exploited, i.e., you only pay double for shields up to the cost of the cheapest thing you could rush
- Cities do not unassign citizens from polluted tiles (arguably not convenient since you're potentially losing the specialist yield)
- [from tjs282] Assign the minimum number of workers necessary to clean pollution
- [from tjs282] Scroll wheel to set gold amount in trade window
- [form Tsubasanut, Civinator, Nanuk] Increase min city distance especially from enemy cities
- [from MartinLuther] "I think an interesting addition would be getting an Advisor Popup whenever another civilization enters a new era."
- [from tjs282] Group units with the same type/health/moves/status on the right click menu
- [from Ares de Borg] "it would be cool to investigate how the AI chooses to build units and if there is a chance to put some kind of ratio to it"

- [from tjs282] Transport box render bug (right sliver of the box persists for some time after it disappears)
- [from tjs282] Bugs with MGLs and armies, some introduced in Conquests:
  - The AI "can't/won't use MGLs to build Armies anymore (but can allegedly still rush Wonders with them, which the human can't)"
  - The AI "can't/won't finish loading (multi-unit) Armies that it's been given (e.g. at Scenario-start, or via autoproduction) so rarely/never sends them out to fight"
